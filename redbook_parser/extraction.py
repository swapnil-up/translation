"""Page text / glyph extraction via PyMuPDF (imported lazily).

Glyph extraction and line clustering are delegated to ``cidmap.decode`` — the
single source of truth for texttrace-based glyph extraction. This module
re-exports them for backward compatibility and adds ``extract_page_text``
(redbook-specific flat text extraction).

SPIKE RESULT (validated on Type0/Identity-H notice PDFs, PyMuPDF 1.28):

- ``page.get_texttrace()`` returns span dicts with the **font subset name**
  and a ``chars`` tuple of per-glyph ``(unicode, glyph_id, origin, bbox)``.
  This is the ONLY API we need: font + CID + bbox per glyph in one pass.
- For unmapped CIDs the ``unicode`` is ``U+FFFD`` and ``glyph_id`` IS the CID.
  ``rawdict``/``get_text`` instead render ``chr(cid)`` fallbacks (control
  chars / ASCII artifacts) — the source of the old EXACT_FIXES table.
- bbox correlation between rawdict and texttrace FAILS (different bbox
  semantics: texttrace bbox is the glyph box, rawdict char bbox is a line
  box). Do not attempt it; texttrace alone is sufficient.
- Same CID maps to different glyphs in different font subsets, so decoding
  must be scoped by ``font`` + ``glyph_id`` (see fonts.py).
